# Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name.
# You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.

print(len(input("What is your name? ")))

# Using variables

name = input("What is your name? ")
print(name)

# Re-writing initial exercise

name = input("What is your name? ")
